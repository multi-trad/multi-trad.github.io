# The project

MULTI-TRAD project has the GOAL of contributing to the development of machine translation (MT) and post-editing (PE) by applying the methodological approach of multidimensional analysis (MDA) developed by Biber (1988) to the analysis of a parallel corpus (ES-EN) of originals, human translations, machine translations and post-edited texts in the Third Social Sector. MDA entails the analysis of a representative corpus and the application of multivariate statistical analysis to identify the co-occurrence of linguistic patters, as well as a methodological synthesis of quantitative and qualitative techniques to interpret the results in functional terms.
The RESULTS of the MULTI-TRAD project are expected to include a unique and innovative MDA in translation studies. The proposed MDA will also serve as a theoretical model for subsequent additive MDA studies. It also will contribute to the MT research, as results obtained from MDA will contribute to improve custom neuronal machine translation (NMT) engines and the design of a best practice report in MT and PE for the Third Social Sector. The MULTI-TRAD MDA will be based on multidisciplinary linguistic-technological knowledge and explore new lines of research for MT, as well as the use of automated processes such as NMT in the Third Sector.
